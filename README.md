Credit:
    AutoCompleteApp code was mostly made by https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/auto-complete-feature-using-trie/
Purpose:
    The purpose of this project was to get practice with using Python/Tries/Django (tentative)
Project Features:
    The app simply takes a word and comes up with a raw list of words the user could be looking for. 
    I plan to add more features like a ranking for the words, a web interface, and maybe even autocorrect.
How to run:
    The project runs on Python 3 and was created using PyCharm
