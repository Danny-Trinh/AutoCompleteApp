AutoCompleteApp template was made by https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/auto-complete-feature-using-trie/
The purpose of this project was to get practice with using Python/Tries/Django (tentative)

The app simply takes a user inputted word and comes up with a raw list of possible words the user could
be about to type. Plan to add more features like a ranking for the words, a web interface, and maybe even autocorrect.

the project runs on Python 3 and was created using PyCharm
